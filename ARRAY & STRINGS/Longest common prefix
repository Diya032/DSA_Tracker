The longest common prefix is common to all the strings. So, we can fix one string and check the common prefix of this string with other strings. The minimum such length is found and the answer is the substring of the fixed string starting from 0 to the length of the above such minimum.
Here, I have fixed 0th string and checked other strings with this.
Full Code:

class Solution {
public:
    string longestCommonPrefix(vector<string>& s) {
        int ans = s[0].length(), n = s.size();
        for(int i=1; i<n; i++){
            int j = 0;
            while(j<s[i].length() && s[i][j]==s[0][j])j++;
            ans = min(ans, j);
        }
        return s[0].substr(0, ans);
    }
};
