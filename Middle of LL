//Approach 3: Initialize the mid element as head and initialize a counter as 0. 
Traverse the list from the head, while traversing increment the counter and change mid to mid->next whenever the counter is odd.
So the mid will move only half of the total length of the list. 

int printmid(class Node *head){
    Node *mid = head;
    count = 0
    
    while( head!= NULL and head->next != NULL){
        head = head->next;
        count++;
        if(count%2 !=0){                        //can write odd condition as such too (count & 1)
            mid = mid->next;
        }
     return mid->data;
    }
